Hello everyone, my name is Alessandro. I'm 20 and I come from Rome, Italy. I am a huge videogames and sports (mainly football and tennis, just below bastketball) fan, other than, obviously, computers.
I have studied at an ICT high school here in Italy were I have studied various programming languages, starting from Assembly and C++, then I studied Java (J2SE) and Web developing, so HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, as well as MySQL for Databases.
I have studied by myself how Android Studio works and I developed a basic app called "Contagi Italia" where you can check day by day how many Coronavirus cases are in Italy, now the application is no more downloadable, maybe it will be again in the near future.
Now I'm studying J2EE, so I'm learning how to use JSPs and Servlets with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX and all the client side web developing languages.

In this account you will find some of my works, like some group projects, some translations for videogames (for example, the italian translation for the TTT2 mod of Garry's Mod). I hope some of this can be useful and that you like it!
Here's a little resum√© of what I did in my life, so far:
 - Graduating in Computer Science at University of Rome Tor Vergata. (2nd year)
 - Developer of the Android app "Contagi Italia". (Not available for download)
 - I have Cambridge C1 certificate for English language (Grade: 182/190 at the First Exam)
 - Winner of the Startupper School Lab local competition (Rome) with SmartDress
 - Winner of the Startupper School Lab regional competition (Lazio) with SmartDress
 - Winner of the Junior Achievement regional competition (Lazio) with SmartDress
